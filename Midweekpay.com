An emergency loan is much like any other personal loan, but you receive the funds faster. This way, you can use the money to pay for an emergency like unexpected medical or dental work, pay a deductible for an auto insurance claim, or pay for emergency travel. Since the best emergency loans are designed to get you money when you need it, the application process is fairly straightforward. You'll find a lender, gather the required documents, and submit your application before funds are deposited into your account.
