Mid week pay

Credit card cash advances are convenient since you can simply withdraw money at an ATM using your credit card. However, the interest rate on cash advances is much higher than what you'd get for a personal loan, and interest is charged immediately, not after the grace period.
Similarly, short-term loans (also called payday loans) are considered predatory because they charge exorbitant fees of up to 400% on average. These loans also demand total repayment in the short term, or steeper penalties are imposed. Several states have banned the use of short-term loans to protect consumers.
